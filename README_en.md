# Portfolio App

[Portuguese version here](README.md)

<br>This Flutter project was created as my Apple Developer Academy portfolio. 
The app is aimed at my personal mobile studies, but also has the intention to present myself, my hobbies, things that I like, my experiences and projects.

## Using the app

The app has 4 screens:
1. Home: tells my hobbies, things that I like. A little about me and my history in general.
2. Vivências (Experiences): has my experiences, scolarships, internships, events that I participate.
3. Projetos (Projects): joins all my projects in one page, since my designs until my podcast and a environmental educational project.
4. Tecnologias (Technologies): It sums up all the technologies that I know, since the most familiar to me until the ones that I had a little contact.
